Safe Human-Robot Collaboration
==============================

We want to provide a ROS-based open source code framework that enables users to test our proposed planning and control framework for exemplary numerical and experimental validation cases on the 7DOF Franka Emika Panda robot, and in realistic Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) scenarios with Vicon motion capture data and Stereolabs ZED2 data.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
